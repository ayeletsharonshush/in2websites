The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

- Relevant error: [lines 62-70](#L62-L70) show Vite’s asset plugin failing to load `attached_assets/IMG_6438_1771951452148.PNG`, causing the build to exit with status 1.

- Diagnosis: Vite tried to bundle `attached_assets/IMG_6438_1771951452148.PNG`, but the file was not accessible during the build (commonly because it was not committed to the repo, was ignored, or the import path/case does not match the actual file).

- Solution:
  1. Verify that `attached_assets/IMG_6438_1771951452148.PNG` is present in your repository with the exact filename (including case) and that it is not excluded by `.gitignore`. Commit it if missing.
  2. If the file exists, update the import to use a relative path that resolves within your project root (e.g., move the asset into `public/` or `src/assets/` and reference it accordingly: `import img from '../assets/IMG_6438_1771951452148.png';` or `<img src="/IMG_6438_1771951452148.png">` if placed in `public/`).
  3. Re-run the Netlify build after confirming the asset is committed and the path is correct.
